> **NOTES**
>
> 1. For the sake of consistency, here is the structure of commands in this cheat sheet:
>
>    - `command [OPTIONS] PARAMETER`
>      - Commands are indicated in lowercase.
>      - Parameters are indicated in uppercase.
>      - Parameters inside square brackets "[ ]" are optional.
>
> 2. You may know more about the command by typing `command --help` or `man command`
>
>    - for example:
>      - `useradd --help` or `man useradd` displays the user manual of command `useradd`
>      - `man echo` for the user manual of command echo
>
> 3. Most of the ZSH command accepts compound options
>    - for example: `ls -alt` combines three options which are `-a (list all including hidden entries )`, `-l (view in long listing format)` and `-t (sort by time)`.

## **TL;DR**

**_User and Group management_**

- List all users: `getent passwd`
- List all groups: `getent group`
- Create user with home directory: `sudo useradd -m USER_NAME`
- Change password: `sudo passwd USER_NAME`
- Remove user including home directory: `sudo userdel -r USER_NAME`
- Create group: `groupadd GROUP_NAME`
- Remove group: `groupdel GROUP_NAME`
- Add user to group: `sudo usermod -aG GROUP USER_NAME`

**_Useful utility_**

- Load profile to current session: `source PATH`

**_Shell scripting_**

- Conditionals:

```sh
if CONDITIONAL_EXPRESSION; then
    ACTIONS
elif CONDITIONAL_EXPRESSION; then
    ACTIONS
else
    ACTIONS
fi
```

```sh
case SUBJECT in

CONDITION_1)

    ACTIONS

;;

CONDITION_2)

    ACTIONS

;;

esac
```

- Loop:

```sh
for ELEMENT in ITERABLE
do
    ACTIONS
done
```

**_Fetching data from internet_**

- Display fetched data: `curl URL`
- Download data:
  - `curl -O URL`
  - `curl -o FILE_NAME URL`
  - `wget --progress=bar URL`
  - `wget --progress=bar -O FILE_NAME URL`

---

## **User and Group management**

User configuration file: `/etc/passwd`  
Password file (All passwords are encrypted): `/etc/shadow`  
Group info file: `/etc/group`

`getent passwd` = List all users

`getent group` = List all groups

`sudo useradd [OPTIONS] USER_NAME` = Create user

- `-d PATH` = Specify home directory for the new user
- `-m` = Create home directory for the new user if it does not exist
- `-s PATH` = Set user's shell (Default shell is /bin/bash)

`sudo passwd USER_NAME` = Change user's password

`sudo usermod [OPTIONS] USER_NAME` = Modify user

- `-aG GROUP` = Add user to group
- `-l NEW_USER_NAME` = Rename user
- `-d NEW_PATH ` = Modify home directory

`su USERNAME` = Switch user (By using `sudo`, you may login without password.)

`sudo userdel [OPTIONS] USER_NAME` = Remove user

- `-r` = Remove user including mail and home directory

`groups` = List groups that the user is currently in

`groupadd [OPTIONS] GROUP_NAME` = Create group

- `-f` = Create group regardless error
- `-g` = With GID (group ID)

`groupmod GROUP_NAME` = Modify group

`groupdel GROUP_NAME` = Remove group

---

## **Useful utility**

`;` = Indicates the end of command

`$` = Articulate variable

`|` = Pipeline connects two commands, pass the output of the former as the **_input_** of the latter
> For example:
>
> - `ls -al ~ | grep .git`
> - `ls -alr ~ | more`


`xargs` = Used with `|`, pass the piped output as the **_argument_** to the latter command
- `-I TOKEN` = Replace string with token
- `-p` = Interactive mode


> For example:
> 
> - `find -type f . | xargs wc` = Recursively list all files of current directory and pass the filenames to `wc` to count the numbers of words, characters and lines of every file.
> - `echo "a b c" | xargs touch` = Create three files named "a", "b" and "c" respectively. 


<!-- awk -->
<!-- TODO -->

`grep [OPTIONS] "PATTERN" FILE` = Search the file for lines containing particular pattern and print it on terminal (or you may use I/O redirection symbol: ">" and ">>" to write the results to file)

- `-c` = Count number of the matched lines
- `-i` = Case insensitive
- `-n` = Print the matched lines with line number
- `-v` = Display lines that do not match the pattern

> **Commands that are often used together with `grep` command:**  
> `more` = Stop displaying once the result exceed the max-number of lines of screen, and prompt the MORE option  
> `sort [OPTIONS]` = Display lines in alphabetical or numeric order
>
> - `-f` = case insensitive
> - `-n` = sort in numeric order
> - `-r` = reverse sorting order
> 
> For example:
>
> - `ls -alR ~| grep .json | sort -r | more`


`eval $COMMAND_VARIABLES` = Run shell command stored in variable(s)

> For example:
>
> 1. `command="ls -alR | grep .json | more"` \
> 2. run `eval $command` (equivalent to run `ls -alR | grep .json | more"`)

`export ENV_VARIABLE=VALUE` = Assign value to a environment variable which can be accessed from all the shells and processes under the same original shell.

`set VARIABLE=VALUE` = Assign value to a local variable.

> Know more about the difference between `export` and `set`, see [article](https://www.theunixschool.com/2010/04/what-is-difference-between-export-set.html)

`source PATH` = Load a profile to current session

---

## **Shell Scripting**

> Create a shell script
>
> 1.  Create a file with .sh extension. e.g. hello.sh
> 2.  Type `#!/bin/zsh` at the very beginning of the file telling the loader executes this script program using ZSH (it would be executed using bash if you type `#!/bin/bash` instead.)
> 3.  Type `echo "Hello World"`(or any other commands you want)
> 4.  Save the file
> 5.  Run `chmod +x hello.sh` in order to give user permission to execute the script (x = execute in symbolic mode)
> 6.  Run the script ./hello.sh and you will see "Hello World" .

`$@` = An array construct
`$1, $2,...` = parameters that pass to the command (1-based indexing, 0 is the command itself)

### **_Conditional statements_**

`test EXPRESSION` = `[ EXPRESSION ]` = Evaluates the expression and returns 0 (true) or 1 (false)  
Use the following operators to constructing expression:

- Logical operators
  - `!` = Negation
  - `-a` = And
  - `-o` = Inclusive or (at least one expression is true)
- Mathematical operators
  - `-eq` = Numerically Equivalent
  - `-ne` = Numerically non-equivalent
  - `-gt` = Greater than
  - `-ge` = Greater than or equal
  - `-lt` = Less than
  - `-le` = Less than or equal
- String comparing
  - `=` = Two strings are equivalent
  - `!=` = Two strings are not equivalent
- File checking
  - `-e` = File exists
  - `-d` = File exists and is a directory
  - `-f` = File exists and is a regular file

`if...then...elif...then...else...fi`

```sh
STRING="Mary had a little lamb"

   # start of the if...fi block
if [ $STRING = "morning" ]; then
   # executes if the expression following "if" keyword returns 0 (true)
   echo "Good morning!"

elif [ $STRING = "afternoon" ]; then
   # executes if the expression following "elif" keyword returns 0 (true)
   echo "Good afternoon!"

else
   # executes if the expressions above does not return 0 (true)
   echo "What should I say?"

   # end of the if...fi block
fi

   # The result is "What should I say?"
```

`case...esac`

```sh
   # start of the case block;
   # $1 refers to the first parameter passed into the program
case $1 in

   # specify the case
-s)
   # execute if the first parameter is -s
    echo "you have -s in args"
   # the end of this case, skip the rest and jump to the end of the entire case block
;;

   # specify the case
*)
   # execute if $1 match this case
    echo "Unknown"
   # same as the above
;;

   # end of the case block
esac
```

### **_Loop statements_**

`for...in...do...done`

```sh

   # start of the looping block
   # $@ is an array-like construct of all parameters
for arg in "$@"

   # start of the computation
do

    echo $arg

   # end of the computation
done
```

## **Fetching data from internet**

`curl [OPTIONS] URL` = Display the fetched data on the terminal

<!-- > NOTE: Install curl using Homebrew: `brew install curl`   -->

- `-C -` = Resume download
- `-I` = Display information of the response header
- `-k` = Allow insecure connections when using SSL
- `-O` = Save data to a file with it original name
- `-o FILE_NAME` = Save data to a file with custom file name
- `--retry NUMBER` = Set number of retries

- `-P PATH/` = Save to specific directory
- `-t NUMBER` = Set number of retries
- `--progress=SYMBOL_TYPE` = Show progress bar (SYMBOL_TYPE can be dot or bar)

<!-- > NOTE: Install wget using Homebrew: `brew install wget`   -->
<!-- > NOTE: Basically, the differences between `curl` and `wget` are:
>
> 1. `curl` supports a lot of protocol, wget supports only http and ftp
> 2. -->
